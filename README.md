# bootstrap-visio-templates

A set of stencils for drawing bootstrap mockups in Visio. Many shapes have configuration features.

## About this project

I’ve always liked Microsoft Visio for drawing quick diagrams. Its smarts shapes click together like 
legos so I can work fast and get results. Visio comes with some user interface stencils, but they’re 
very limited, and not suitable for designing web application interfaces. That’s why I went and looked 
for Bootstrap stencils for Visio on the web. There were a few results, but what I found were stencils
with shapes that weren’t smart: the shapes didn’t scale well, and had no built-in functionality.

What I’d like to see is a stencil full of smart shapes that can be configured: a button that you can 
right-click to make it default, primary, success, warning or danger, rather than having five separate 
buttons. A dropdown menu that allows you to drag in menu options and separators, which automatically 
stretch the menu to accommodate them. A form input field that allows you to right-click it to set its
current state (valid, warning, invalid), with an optional feedback icon, and so on.

That’s why I set out to develop my own Bootstrap Stencils for Visio, with Font Awesome icons thrown 
in for good measure:
